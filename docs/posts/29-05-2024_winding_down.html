# WINDING DOWN
(i was never wound up in the first place)
----------
29-05-2024

writing this while i wait for something to flash...

since exams are done, ive been winding down        (i think americans would call these your midterms)
which means ive been playing with code and os's
though, it didnt really seems like i was very
wound up for the exams in the first place, which is a weird feeling,
considering how important these exams should have been.
but i didnt feel that panic(?) i usually do before tests this time
around.

      which you know, its a good thing! i also didnt do
      bad (i did pretty good in fact) in these exams,
      but like.

      where did the stress go

but im not one to complain about that.
since its over, ive been working on press and things, and
its fun. ive been experimenting with linux distros, and
im a little interested in setting up a server (for real this time).

  the current road map is like

  get a new distro (not arch) >> get telnet working properly >> try to communicate
                                                                to my other
                                                                computer

  and its cool and fun. its got me thinking about technology too.
  you know, technology sometimes FEELS like an art. by learning and
  using it, you are able to shape the world around you and create
  new things. its great, but imagine this in everyones hands.

       what a wonderful world it would be.
       it doesnt even have to be fancy stuff, but everyone
       even had like the barest of knowledge on this stuff,
       imagine the things we could make.

 its beautiful
