# THE MYTH OF GREEN

> the great thing about legends
  is that, it doesn't need to be
  true for you to believe it.

the general principles and philosophy of me,
because its always interesting to see what
makes others tick.

<a href="THE">BANDANA</a>
   what you cant see, you cant believe
   and what you choose not to see, you cant fear
   
<a href="HUMANISE">EXISTENTIAL THREATS</a>
   if it has a name, it can be known
   if it has a face, it can be overcome
   
<a href="EVERYTHING">MATTERS</a>
   nihilism is stupid. optimistic nihilism too.
   
<a href="FUEL">FOR A FIRE</a>
   its not the goal, its the kindlings
   
<a href="HE">IS HIM IS ME</a>
   so, what if you chose to embody hope?
   and why other symbols and poses matter.
   
<a href="FIGHT">AGAINST THE WORLD</a>
   the world is strong
   but i'm indomitable
   
<a href="MY">SOUL</a>
   my body is a mere vessel
   and my mind is a limitation
   
<a href="THAT">SHADOW</a>
   try as i might, it still lurks
   around the corner.

<a href="A">FEATHERWEIGHT?</a>
   life's not a joke, but you
   don't need to take it so
   seriously. (lighten up!)

<a href="NOT">HUBRIS (yet)</a>
   icarus thought he could beat a god.
   i know i can, but i'll try anyways.

<a href="ENTROPY">IS ORDER</a>
   is a stew of evenly distributed particle where
   nothing more happens really chaotic?

<a href="ONE">RULE</a>
   never look back. ever.
   there's nothing left there for you.
   the only way is forwards.
