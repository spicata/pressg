# NIXOS MIGRATION NOTES (for me)
----------
03-06-2024

semi-technical stuff, mainly as a reminder for me.

anyways i probably want to use bash + oh my bash because crush and mess works with that
also i might use alacritty or kitty? ill need to test more because i dont really know,
i might also just end up sticking with the default terminal, its alright on nixos.

also flakes isnt really working for some apparent reason i dont really know why.

ill try to work on that but we'll see how it goes

try to remember this:

   > environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [ 
   >   stuff 
   > ];

& also

   > sudo nixos-rebuild swtich



in other news, fake regex (hopscotch) is going badly and i have no clue what the problem
is.
