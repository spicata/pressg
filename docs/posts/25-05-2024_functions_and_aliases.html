# even more link changes
----------
25-05-2024

i functionified the linkage

also now links such as => https://google.com shouldn't work
i'll start work on aliases now that thats figured out now

aliases finally work

<a href="https://google.com">this is a link to google!</a>

though... => isnt always very convenient, especially for intrawebsite links.
wikilinks are next?

if this works, then it should appear inline as well <a href="/pressg/index">/index</a>
