# even more link changes
----------
25-05-2024

i functionified the linkage

also now links such as => https://google.com shouldn't work
i'll start work on aliases now that thats figured out now

aliases finally work

<a href="https://google.com">this is a link to google!</a>

though... => isnt always very convenient, especially for intrawebsite links.
wikilinks are next?

if this works, then it should appear inline as well <a href="/pressg/index">index</a>
surely so should this <a href="/pressg/posts/23-05-2024_python_cleanup_and_crush">23-05-2024_python_cleanup_and_crush</a>
and it slugs as well! <a href="/pressg/another_page">another_page</a>
and aliases too! <a href="/pressg/another_page">this is so cool</a>
