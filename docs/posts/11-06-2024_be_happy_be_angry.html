# BE HAPPY, BE ANGRY
----------
11-06-2024

(a look into my mental)

if you can be happy, or content,
of course, that is the best out-
come. but if you can't be happy,
then don't fall into that pit of
despair. that endless cycle of
self-doubt and self-loathing.

 if you can't be happy,
              be angry.

   framing matters a lot. if you
   trick yourself into believing
   that whatever happened is your
   fault, then its easy to make
   yourself feel like shit.

   you'll end up thinking:
   
     if it is your fault, then the
     blame lies with you. the res-
     ponsibility lies with you. you
     should have done better. the
     fact that this has happened is
     a reflection of your skill
     or character or something else
     about you.

     you are the problem.

   which, whether its true
   or not, is not a useful
   way of thinking. or more
   importantly, its not a
   fun way of thinking. it
   doesn't really help the
   mental.

   lets frame it differently.
   whatever problem you have, strip
   away all the details. whether it
   be difficulties in work, or study;
   trouble with friends; existential
   dread; or whatever else. at the
   heart of it, its a challenge that
   you will have to overcome.

    and its not a challenge of your own making
    (for now, lets say that). its one the world
    has passed down to you. its a problem you've
    inherited. and are you going to let the 
    world beat you?

    > at this point... yea-

    NO. WRONG ANSWER. YOU AREN'T GOING TO GIVE
    UP NOW. ARE YOU?

    > okay fine. i will

    thats right. sure you've been given a
    problem that might not have been yours
    by the world. but you're not going to
    let it stop you, right?

     earth has presented its challenge.
     all you have to do is step up to
     face it.

  and the thing is, you probably
  will not succeed. the entire
  world is a pretty hard foe to
  beat. id fail too, if thats
  any consolation. 

   but the thing is, you don't 
   need to beat the world. no-
   body excepts you to. all
   you have to do is get back
   up once you're down.

   from now on, your strength
   is not whether you can beat
   the world or not. its not
   how long you can last each
   time. its whether or not
   you can get back up after
   each time.

   its about perseverance, not skill.

   and if you've gotten this far, id
   say you're already doing pretty well.
      it doesnt matter if you
      think you are strong
      enough to persevere.
      because i know you are.

     but hey, take your time.
     have a break every once
     in a while.  its a hard
     challenge. sometime you
     really do need to let it
     all out. wallowing a
     little is alright. but
     just promise me that you'll
     be back.


  theres a little caveat though.
  i am not a perfect person. if
  the problems are all entirely
  my fault (say, maybe im too
  arrogant) then you do need to
  fix it probably i dunno.

    but if you can recognise that,
    also recognise that... well
    maybe it wasn't your fault
    you are like this. the world
    dealt you a bad hand.
    changing your hand is your
    form of resistance. keeping
    it is only submitting.
