# WATERPROOF LAPTOPS
  and also what i'd
  do with a desktop.

okay look i like having a thin and semi-powerful laptop.     (it could be better)
i have an xps-13 and, all things considered, its alright.
but its thin and light, and that makes it easily portable.
which is good, but i feel like it should either be more
powerful or more portable. and im leaning towards the more
portable side.

   laptops are portable desktops.
   but since they are so small,
   they are limited by the heat
   management that they are able
   to contain inside them. this
   means that, no matter how
   powerful the stuff inside is,
   its still going to be limited
   by the form itself.

     but i don't really need a really
     powerful laptop. quite literally
     all i really need to be able to 
     do on this is:
   1. write text, like this.
   2. search things up and use some
      browsers.

     so i kind of feel like the current
     state of laptops are a little
     bit overkill for those two things?
     if you know what i mean.

   and sure, apps and websites keep getting more
   and more resource intensive, and keep needing
   more and more powerful computers to run, but
   i feel like that shouldn't really need to be
   the case.

    with some clever programming and optimisations,
    surely it *would* be possible to actually make
    things run better on slower computers. and its
    not like its the hardware thats limiting us,
    because stuff like linux, especially with desktop 
    environments like XFCE run much better even on 
    slow computers.

    and if you can't optimise your code,
    then... well i get its hard but you
    really should be able to, right? it
    should be at least one of the
    priorities as developers right?

      of course, some programs can't really be
      optimised to a sufficient degree. stuff
      that runs simulations or llm models or
      graphical renderers obviously need stronger
      computers.

      but does it need to be laptops? can't
      they be run on desktops?


 in my opinion, we should cut
 down the power of laptops but
 increase its portability. not
 necessarily their weight and
 size, but also making it rain
 proof, for example. it doesn't need to be confined to what you
                     think a normal laptop should be. 
                     why not make the screen more paperlike for
                     example. it doesn't need to be glass and 
                     glossy. the xps has a really good matte
                     screen

                     or even, why even need laptops. how about
                     portable screens like an ipad that you can
                     just attach a keyboard to? that way, you                  (you should be able to attach it with
                     can even write on the screen.                             a usb c or a connection. not like a
                                                                               surface pro. surface pros are really
          make it able to switch between a true tablet and a true              really bad.)
          laptop mode. like what windows 10 tried to do but couldn't.
          like what apple (from what i know) hasn't done.

             or maybe touchscreens can get better! there's
             no reason why it needs to be limited to tablets
             and some laptops. (to be honest, i think its
             kind of haphazardly done on computers at the
             moment, but it would be nice to have in the future. maybe its able to be
                                                         toggleable on and off. that
                                                         would be a sick addition.)


    a touchscreen waterproof sandproof lightweight laptop
    would be awesome. right?


to be honest, laptops really shouldn't be used
on such intensive things anyways. but if you
reduce its specs and instead optimise the things
that runs on it, you could cut down cuts on
laptops. and using that money, maybe invest in a
desktop. those things are better suited for actual
computing if thats what you need.
